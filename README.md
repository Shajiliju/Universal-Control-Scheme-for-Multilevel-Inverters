# Universal-Control-Scheme-for-Multilevel-Inverters
A MATLAB model of the Universal control Scheme has been developed, in accordance to the paper IEEE paper presented by Mr. K.K Gupta and Mr. Shailander Jain. 
This scheme can be used for any multilevel inverter topology, to implement any popular modulation technique. The file shown has been developed for 7-level inverter, 
but can be extended for any number of levels.  The files consists of implementation for Phase Dispostion PWM, Phase Opposition Disposition PWM, 
Alternate Phase Opposition Dipostion PWM, Phase shift Pwm. All the files are matlab files.

 Stage I: Appropriate selection of carriers and reference
enables the proposed scheme to incorporate required
modulation strategy.

 Stage II: Appropriate manipulations with the aggregated
flexibility to implement charge balance
control in input DC sources. 

 Stage III: Look-table can be formulated based on the
topology and hence the scheme is applicable to all multilevel
topologies.
